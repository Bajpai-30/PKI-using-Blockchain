# PKI-Smart-Contract

We propose a new and efficient PKI model, to make a digital certificate and
their revocation status and process transparent. 
Contributions:
• Provide transparency in revocation and certificate validation process.
• Removal of the trusted key store in the client(e.g web browser).
